Hi! Welcome to LemonMES! <br/>
<br/>
LemonMES is a Manufacturing Execution Software (MES) designed to track production at a simulated citric acid plant that friends of mine designed for their senior capstone project. The plant runs in batch configuration and produces citric acid from biomass. LemonMES keeps track of batches in production, calculates important data on plant operation, and allows different functionality for different roles at the plant. Users can view plant data, update batch records, and update unit operation functioning with an interactive web application. <br/>

My goal with this project was to gain hands-on experience with ASP.NET software development, as well as C#, Java, and SQL, and apply it to my chemical engineering background. I am interested in applying software to make chemical and pharmaceutical manufacture more efficient and this project has helped me think about how that can be applied in the real world.
